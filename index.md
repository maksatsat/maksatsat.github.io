## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.JPG">

Hi!

I am an astrophysics PhD student at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and member of the [LOVE-NEST team](https://home.phys.ntnu.no/LOVE-NEST/). My research focuses on neutron stars in binary systems. Currently, I am stydying high energy emission (X-rays and gamma-rays) from spider systems (compact binary millisecond pulsars).

I did my bachelors and masters at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) and the Space Research Institute (IKI).
I worked on different transient X-ray sources such as Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs), Red Supergiant X-ray Binaries (RSG XBs) and X-ray bursters.
