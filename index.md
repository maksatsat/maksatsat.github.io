## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.JPG">

Hi! I'm Maksat, an upcoming PhD student at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).


During my MS and BS at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Space Research Institute (IKI) I worked on transient X-ray sources such as Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs), Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SgXBs) and X-ray bursters.
